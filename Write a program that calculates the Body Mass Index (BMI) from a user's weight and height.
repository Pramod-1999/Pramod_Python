//Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
//The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height.
//The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m)

height = input("Enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("Enter your weight in kg: ")

h=float(height)**2
w=int(weight)
BMI = int(w/h)
print(BMI)

OR

BMI = int(weight) / float(height)**2
BMI_INT = int(BMI)

O/P :-  Enter your height in m: 1.75
        Enter your weight in kg: 80
        26.
